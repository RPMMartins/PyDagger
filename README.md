# PyDagger
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) Python Tkinter Editor Project which schedules python code execution.

This project is currently under devolopment.

The following features are being implemented:
                1. Render DAGs. - Done
                2. Move DAGs with mouse drag and mouse wheel. - Done
                3. Zoom in/out DAGs. - Done
                4. Drag Nodes with mouse drag with adaptive edges. - Done
                5. Adding Child/Parent Nodes to any node. - Done
                6. Add edges between any nodes (without creating cycles).
                7. Remove edges/nodes.
                8. Execute Python in Accordance to the DAG. - Done
                9. Save DAG changes both dependencies/style.
                10. Add layer assignment for nodes. - Done
                11. Use Heuristic Methods for edge crossing reduction.
